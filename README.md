# DrinkIt - Trinda's Fork
WoW Addon - Food &amp; Drink Macro Generator  
With permission from the original developer nObbY530, I have taken over maintenance for this addon.

========== Original Description ==========

**What does this addon do?**  
This addon creates two macros, "AutoHP" and "AutoMP". These macros are dynamically updated and always provide the user with the best food and drink. In addition, potions and stones are offered in combat.


**How does it work?**  
Other addons are based on lists. Either created by the user or mostly obsolete by the developer. This addon does not need hard coded lists. It reads the necessary data from the WoW API. This ensures a long run even without expensive maintenance. And the best part is. It works in Classic Era, Burning Crusade Classic, and Shadowlands.


**Are there still open problems?**  
The localization. I localized the addon for english and german. Maybe I will add more later.
